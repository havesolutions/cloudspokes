                  If you give feedback on the Website, for example recommendations for improvements
                  or features, such feedback will be deemed non-confidential and non-proprietary,

                  to give you notice that we are removing your User Content. We may also terminate
                  your account if we decide that you are a repeat infringer. We consider a repeat
                  infringer to be a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice
                  or who has had User Content removed from our Website more than twice.

                  Under no circumstances will Appirio or its suppliers be held liable for any damages
                  due to such interruptions or lack of availability.

                  of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of any third-party. Your

                  and your use of the Website.
                %b Termination and Suspension.
                %p

                  Further, we may terminate or suspend your permission to use the Website immediately
                  and without notice upon any violation of these Terms of Service, your failure to

                  for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems
                  or for engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. If we terminate your
                  use of the Website for any of these reasons or otherwise for cause, we will not
                  refund any fees you may have paid, whether for access to the Website or for Products

                %p
                  Upon any termination we may delete your account, passwords and User Content, and
                  we may bar you from further use of the Website. You understand that we may also
                  continue to make your User Content available on the Website even if your use of
                  the Website is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability
                  to you or any third party for termination of your account or access to the Website.

                  regulations.
                %b Additional Terms.
                %p
                  Portions of the Website may be accompanied by additional terms which apply to specific
                  features or areas of the Website. Those additional terms supplement these terms
                  with respect to your use of those features or areas.
                %b General Terms.
                %p
                  These Terms of Service are governed by laws of the state of California, without
                  regard to its conflict of laws rules. The sole jurisdiction and venue for any claim
                  arising from the Website and these Terms of Service shall be the state and federal
                  courts located in San Mateo, California and each party hereby consents to the exclusive
                  jurisdiction and venue of such courts. These Terms of Service, together with our
                  Privacy Policy and any other legal notices we have published on the Website, constitute
                  the entire agreement between you and us regarding this Website. If a court having
                  proper authority decides that any portion of these Terms of Service is invalid,
                  only the part that is invalid will not apply. The rest of these Terms of Service
                  will still be in effect. If we waive any of our rights under these Terms of Service
                  in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights generally
                  or in the future. Furthermore, just because we may not enforce all our rights all
                  of the time, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights. We may decide to enforce
                  them at a later date. These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted
                  under these Terms of Service, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may
                  be assigned by us without restriction.
