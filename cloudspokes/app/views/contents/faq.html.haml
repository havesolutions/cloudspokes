                                  Every competition will have a number of individuals identified as reviewers. Their
                                  job is to examine each submission and conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis
                                  of the submission. This is done using standard scorecards as well as a comparison
                                  with challenge’s requirements. Each submission is anonymized before the reviewer
                                  examines it to ensure impartiality and fairness.
